# Quick Deploy Commands

## üöÄ Deploy Backend to Railway
```bash
# 1. Push your code to GitHub (if not already done)
git add .
git commit -m "feat: production deployment configuration"
git push origin main

# 2. Go to railway.app and:
# - Sign up with GitHub
# - Create new project
# - Connect repository: BINABASS091/amazing-kuku
# - Railway auto-detects Python and deploys
# - Get your backend URL: https://your-app.railway.app
```

## üåê Deploy Frontend to Vercel
```bash
# 1. Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# 2. Deploy (run from project root)
vercel

# Follow prompts:
# - Link to existing project? N
# - Project name: amazing-kuku
# - Directory: ./
# - Override settings? N

# 3. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-app.railway.app
# VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
# VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key

# 4. Redeploy with environment variables
vercel --prod
```

## ‚úÖ Test Deployment
```bash
# Test backend
curl https://your-backend-app.railway.app/health

# Test frontend
# Open https://your-app.vercel.app
# Try disease prediction feature
```

## üéØ **The Fix**
Your deployment files are already created:
- `railway.toml` - Backend deployment config
- `Procfile` - Process definition  
- `runtime.txt` - Python version
- `vercel.json` - Frontend config with environment variables

The main issue was that your frontend was trying to connect to `localhost:8000` in production. Now it will use the deployed backend URL from `VITE_API_BASE_URL` environment variable.
